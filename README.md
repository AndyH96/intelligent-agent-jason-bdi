##  Overview
The Intelligent Agent Jason Project utilizes AgentSpeak, a programming language for developing intelligent agents, implemented through JASON, a BDI (Belief, Desire, Intention) agent-oriented programming platform.

## Project Description
The project features various sample environments, each with a hero agent. The primary goal of the hero agent is to collect specific items within the environment and return them to the goblin. The use of BDI operations allows the agent to exhibit intelligent behavior, making decisions based on its beliefs, desires, and intentions.
